# CLI Snake Game Documentation

## Game Mechanics
The CLI Snake Game is a simple, terminal-based game where the player controls a snake to consume food items that appear randomly on the game board. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with the game board boundaries or itself.

## Code Structure
The game is structured into three main components:
- `input_handler.py`: Handles real-time keyboard input without blocking the game loop.
- `game.py`: Contains the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
- `renderer.py`: Responsible for rendering the game state to the terminal and displaying the score and game over message.

## Functionality
The game features include:
- Real-time keyboard input for snake control.
- Collision detection with the game board and the snake itself.
- Score tracking displayed in real-time during gameplay.
- Food placement at random locations on the game board.

## User Instructions
To start the game, run the `snake_game.py` script in your terminal. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the game board boundaries or the snake's body.

## Final Presentation Materials
The final presentation will include:
- A live demonstration of the game.
- An overview of the game's code and architecture.
- Discussion of the game's features and how they meet the project requirements.
- Instructions for downloading, installing, and starting the game.

Thank you for playing the CLI Snake Game!
