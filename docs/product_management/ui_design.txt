UI Design Draft:

UI Elements:
- Game Board: A grid that represents the playing field where the snake moves.
- Snake: A line of characters that grows in length each time it consumes food.
- Food: A special character that appears randomly on the game board and is consumed by the snake.
- Score: A section of the screen that displays the current score of the player.
- Game Over Screen: A message that appears when the game ends, showing the final score and a prompt to play again or exit.

Functions:
- Initialize Game: Set up the game board, place the initial snake and food, and set the score to zero.
- Move Snake: Update the snake's position based on user input.
- Check Collision: Determine if the snake has collided with the game board boundaries or itself.
- Generate Food: Place a new food item on the board when the previous one is consumed.
- Update Score: Increase the score when the snake consumes food.
- End Game: Display the Game Over Screen when a collision is detected.

Style:
- The game will use a simple and clean text-based interface.
- The snake can be represented by a series of 'O' characters, and the food by an 'X'.
- The game board will be bordered by a set of '-' and '|' characters.
- The score will be displayed in plain text at the top or bottom of the game board.

Layout:
- The game board will be centered in the terminal window.
- The score will be displayed at the top of the game board.
- The Game Over Screen will clear the game board and display the message in the center of the terminal.
